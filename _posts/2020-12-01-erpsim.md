<h3 class="article-sub">Challenge</h3>
<div class="article-text">
<p>We aim to improve the experience of instructors and students using the ERPsim Console. The underlying
hypothesis is that perceived quality, ease of learning and student engagement can all be enhanced by
intervening the graphical user interface: layout and control components, data tables and graphics, and the
sequence in which information is displayed or accessed. It is expected that this will have a positive impact
in reducing the friction of “adoption” by instructors and improving the debriefing phase of simulations thus
positively impacting student learning.

<ol>
<li>Simplify first time usage (Ease of Learning)</li>
<li>Improve the in-game debriefing experience</li>
<li>Update to current usability standards</li>
<li>Prepare the interface for incremental improvement</li>

<h3 class= "stage-title">1. Context</h3>
ERPsim is a business simulation game for SAP ERP and SAP S/4HANA in which participants use a real ERP system to manage their virtual company in a competitive market. Win or lose, participants will improve their knowledge of business processes and their understanding of how ERP systems are effective at managing those processes.
