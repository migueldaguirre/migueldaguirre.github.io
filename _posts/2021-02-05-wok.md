<h3 class="article-sub">Context</h3>
<div class="article-text">
  <p>
    In 2013, Bogotá-based restaurant group <strong>WOK / Lao Kao</strong> partnered with a graduate
    design-thinking team from Universidad de los Andes to re-imagine the
    <em>table-closure and billing</em> stage across its 19 full-service locations.  
    The students carried out immersive front- and back-of-house research,
    mapping every step of the existing workflow to inform later prototypes.

<h3 class="article-sub">Challenge</h3>
<div class="article-text">
  <p>
    Fieldwork revealed a tangle of pain points: wait-staff made multiple
    “<em>vueltas</em>” between table, POS, and a single crowded cashier desk, queues built up,
    data-entry errors crept in, and staff worried about unpaid bills,
    lost tips, and time stolen from other duties. The bottleneck stressed
    both employees and diners.

<h3 class="article-sub">Outcome</h3>
<div class="article-text">
  <p>
    Rapid in-situ prototypes removed one full trip by combining bill- and
    voucher-printing, introduced modular cash trays to keep each check
    organized, added single-tap POS shortcuts, and slipped playful
    server-name cards into every bill. Pilot tests showed faster payments,
    fewer mix-ups, and improved guest connection; the low-cost tweaks were
    adopted in the pilot outlet and subsequently rolled out chain-wide.
