<h3 class="article-sub">Challenge</h3>
<p>We aim to improve the experience of instructors and students using the ERPsim Console. The underlying
hypothesis is that perceived quality, ease of learning and student engagement can all be enhanced by
intervening the graphical user interface: layout and control components, data tables and graphics, and the
sequence in which information is displayed or accessed. It is expected that this will have a positive impact
in reducing the friction of ‚Äúadoption‚Äù by instructors and improving the debriefing phase of simulations thus
positively impacting student learning.
