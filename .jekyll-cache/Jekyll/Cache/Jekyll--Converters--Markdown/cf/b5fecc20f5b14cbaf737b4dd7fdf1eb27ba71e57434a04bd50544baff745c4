### Challenge
Reinvent the online experience for enrolling into university courses by setting up a course selection system that can be used by all schools in Quebec to standardize practices in the community and give students a better experience. Using the current platform as a staring point.
Concept Testing
Refining the idea: Card sorting

As an exercise in the UX Design course within the MSc. in User Experience in a Business Context. Following a systemic/structured process of empathizing, ideation, user testing and iterative prototyping.

Card sorting for defining information hierarchy.
All the information that was relevant during each step of the enrollment process. Then was prioritized using card sorting software.

The heart of the experience is like going shopping in a store or an e-commerce site. The goal is to find one's way easily inside, to choose the product that perfectly meets our expectations, to be able to buy it without stress and to exchange it in the future if one wishes.

This text was developed during / as part of the UX design course with the MSC in User Experience in a Business Context, at HEC Montréal.

The main objective was to explore alternative interactions fro an existing experience, while applying a well structured process for ideation, exploration and prototyping.

Getting some exposure / experience using standard tools like personas, user journeys, value diagrams, ideation, etc.

The prototype was built on Axure 9.0. and had three cycles of iteration - user testing.

After defining our persona, we made 10 interviews. This provided content for detailing the profiles as well as confirmation about the relevance of the project.

The values / principles behind the new interface were:
Enhance visibility during the process.

Explore alternatives for fragmented / multiscreen flows.

This was particularly important because the consequences / effects of some choices were not evident right away.

The linear interaction didn’t allow for visualizing the calendar

Remove the need for keeping the information in another file
Include new features

Sequences in which most of the contextual elements are persistent, a sen sense of space, of physicality, as a tangible artifact.

The case for single page applications vs. Multiscreen

We decided to make a card sorting, to decide which elements were more relevant and also how they were related to each other. Todo so, we used Optimal Workshop. And got responses from x people

Icons, colors, contrast, legibility

Feature prioritization - Value vs. Effort

Summary of notes / value proposition

Result: Outcome: A single page web app with a fluid (non-fragmented interaction) that is also adaptive. It includes all the features previously available in the original version.
