The main objective was to determine the strengths and weaknesses, in terms of usability, of the various steps required to install the detector on the application. The results of these tests will be used to inform the development team of adjustments and modifications to consider to improve the experience of its users. These results will also make it possible to verify whether the installation steps are sufficiently understandable. This report will present, among other things, the results observed as well as the appropriate recommendations.
